# Team Specialk Repository

The beginning stages of compiling necessary metadata for animals and studies within Team Specialk have been completed. For now, data about different animals, surgeries, experiments, etc will be created by generating files. The best solution would be to develop a database, probably in DataJoint given its support for NWB files and many tools for storing neurophsyiology data, that can also interact with the Transnetyx Colony suite that has been recently adopted by the lab.

This repo will include work by team Specialk's members (though not exclusively! Anyone in the lab is welcome to contribute!) as we all collaborate to build a repository that's dedicated to manipulating the study's data into the new directory structure being done for the lab. Therefore, the following kinds of projects will be contained here:
- Animal metadata generation
- Animal surgery information
- Transnetyx Colony interactions/subject selection
- Sucrose Preference Test data manipulation/visualization
- Learned Helplessness data manipulation/visualization
- 3-Chamber sociability data manipulation/visualization
- 2-photon data manipulation/visualization
- Grepping for different animals in studies with particular properties
- Dataset generation generally for visualization/analysis
- Blink data recording via `Gunpowder`
- Whatever else the team can think of/implement

Another goal for this repo is to offer smaller example projects that team members newer to programming (primarily in Python, but MATLAB as well) can take head-on and then add to the lab's general abilities!

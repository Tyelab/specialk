# Team Specialk Database

The beginning stages of compiling necessary metadata for animals and studies within Team Specialk have been completed. For now, data about different animals, surgeries, experiments, etc will be created by generating files. The best solution would be to develop a database, probably in DataJoint given its support for NWB files and many tools for storing neurophsyiology data, that can also interact with the Transnetyx Colony suite that has been recently adopted by the lab.

Example files for subjects can be found inside of the specialk project directories on the snlktdata server in `animal_metadata`.

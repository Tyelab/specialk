    "Hey, Sama! Here's an introductory notebook about a few key concepts in Python: `strings`, `iterables`, `for loops`, and `If/Else statements`. We'll go over each of them one at a time and in a little detail via examples. This is my first attempt at explaining things to a budding programmer so let me know if none of this makes sense or is too far! We can go as slow as you need."

    "Strings are a `data type` that encode `characters`. `Data types` basically are different ways of representing information for a computer. We don't need to worry too much about them now.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most commonly, you'll see `strings` used for words or letters but ocasionally even numbers are stored as strings! So what makes something a string and not something else? The magical `quotes` and `apostrophe` keys!\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's some examples of them:\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"I am a string\"\n",
    "- 'I am also a string!'\n",
    "- \"I am a string that contains the number 4!\"\n",
    "- 'I too am a string containing the number 4!'\n",
    "- \"String.\"\n",
    "- 'string'\n",
    "- etc...\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice anything about these examples?\n",
    "\n",
    "The main thing to see is that the start and stop of the string are the same thing! You can't intermix `quotes` with `apostrophes` to start and stop a string. What I mean by that is:\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"Can't do this!'\n",
    "- 'Can't do this either!\"\n",

For example, if you forget to write down frosting on your shopping list, then you won't be able to finish your cake later. You can also account for more than two choices by using `else if` aka `elif` in your code. We'll go through an example later...\n",
